# maze-builder
Creates random mazes with Union-Find

This is a small Java program that creates mazes of specified size (MxN) using a union-find algorithm (Quick Union).  

I was too lazy to draw out the mazes by hand so I added code to do the calculations. The standard draw library (thanks Mr. Sedgewick and Mr. Wayne) renders the created maze. 

Included example visual as requested.
